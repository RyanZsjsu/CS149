Generate Workload
	Rename page_size to process_size_in_pages to match schema in directions
		Randomly assign each process a size of 5, 11, 17, and 31 MB (1 page = 1 MB)
	Rename completion_time to service_duration to match schema in directions
Free Page List
	Create a linked list with initial value of 100 nodes
Paging
	Make a function to determine what page will be referenced next
Process Execution
	If four pages or more are available from the free page list, start a new job
	All processes start at page0
	After 100ms, there is a reference to another memory location
	Record these reference statistics <time-stamp in seconds, process Name, page-referenced, Page-in-memory, which process/page number will be evicted if needed> 
Simulationâ€¨	Run simulation 5 times for each page replacement algorithm
	Calculate average hit/miss ratio
	Create memory map
	Print record when process is swapped in or completed
	Print average number of processes swapped in
